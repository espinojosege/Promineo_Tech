  <p>
Week 07 for the Promineo Tech Front End Coding bootcamp is about HTML.
This week we are learning everything HTML. HTML stands for HyperText
Markup Language. It is typed like regular text but things can be encased
inside of tags. A tag is text inside a less than &lt;&&gt; and greater
than symbols. The tag has to be opened and closed. This means that
The text written after the &lt;&&gt; tag, has to be closed with same
symbols but with an forward slash after the first symbol.The text inside
the symbols has  to be a keyword predefined by the HyperText Markup
Language. For example, "H1" inside &lt;&&gt; symbols, creates a tag that
marks that text inside the opening tag and closing tag as heading text.
The example would be written as follows: &lt;H1&gt;Heading&lt;/H1&gt;.
HTML is powerful as it is the base for all websites in the internet.
